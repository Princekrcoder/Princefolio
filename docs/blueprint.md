## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#708090) to convey professionalism, trust, and stability. 
- Background color: Soft, desaturated off-white (#F5F5F5) for a clean and modern look. This provides good contrast and prevents the design from appearing too stark. 
- Accent color: muted, warm yellow (#E4D00A), adding contrast and personality while maintaining an overall sense of restraint. This should be used sparingly, on interactive or attention-grabbing elements. 
- Body text and Headlines: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use simple and professional icons to represent different sections and technologies used in projects. Consistent style and color palette will add visual cohesion.
- Employ a clean and modern layout with a clear visual hierarchy to guide the user's eye and make it easy to find information. Consider a single-page layout with smooth scrolling for a seamless experience.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement without being distracting. For example, a fade-in effect on page load or a smooth transition between sections.
